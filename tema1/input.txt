In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information.
This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.
Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.
Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would be interceptor.

The dog (Canis familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail.
The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.
